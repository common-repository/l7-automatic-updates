Set individual plugins, major and minor WordPress releases, themes and all plugins to automatically update.

== Description ==

A simple plugin that gives you the flexibility to set whether you want individual plugins to update or not.  This is something I find very useful on many of my sites.  Some plugins have been edited by previous Developers and they cannot be updated.  Other plugins on the same site still need to be updated.  You can set this to update the ones that can be updated automatically and don't need specific attention.

Choose whether you want the updater to update even though you are using a version control system such as SVN or git.

**Users can set automatic updates:**

*  For Major Wordpress Releases
*  For Minor Wordpress Releases
*  For Themes
*  For All Plugins
*  For Individual Plugins
*  Change notification email address.
